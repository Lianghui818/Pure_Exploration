# Pure Exploration for Asynchronous Federated Bandits

**Introduction**

This project investigates the federated pure exploration problem within multi-armed and linear bandits settings, where multiple agents collaborate to identify the best arm under communication with a central server. Addressing common issues like latency and unavailability of clients in practical scenarios, we introduce the first federated asynchronous algorithms for multi-armed bandit (MAB) and linear bandit models aimed at pure exploration with fixed confidence. Our approach balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off efficiently, even in fully asynchronous environments, enhancing robustness against delays and agent unavailability while minimizing communication costs.
